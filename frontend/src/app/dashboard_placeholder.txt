// We need to implement a backend endpoint to fetch "My Groups" first.
// Since backend is already "done", I will edit backend/src/controllers/groups.ts 
// and backend/src/routes/groups.ts to add `GET /groups` (my groups).
// I will do this in a subsequent step if needed. 
// For now, I'll create the Dashboard UI assuming the endpoint exists or stubbing it.
// Actually, I should fix the backend first.

// Wait, I can't easily query "groups I am in" with the current schema efficiently 
// without a join or specialized query on the JSONB column. 
// Drizzle: `sql` operator can be used for JSONB containment.
// `sql`${expenses.participants} @> ${userId}`` 
// I will start by updating the backend controller effectively.
